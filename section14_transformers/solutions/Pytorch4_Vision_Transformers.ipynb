    "We've already seen how you can break up an image into a sequence of patches and use sequential processing (with an LSTM). Now lets see how we can use attention to create a transformer that can process images, a Vision Transformer! First introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929) the Vision Transformer (ViT) Takes the idea of adding self-attention to the extreame, treating an image as a sequence of patches and then using an Encoder-Only Transformer as a Classifier!"
