    "With our knowledge of Python and now Numpy lets create an implementation of a famous machine learning algorithm \"K-Means Clustering\". The job of a clustering algorithm is to break a dataset into some number of \"clusters\" (groups), the number of clusters usually defined by the user. K-Means clustering working by iteratively updating  a pre-defined number of cluster centers. It does this by finding the distance between each datapoint and every cluster center. Datapoints are then assigned to the cluster center they are closest to and each cluster center is updated to be the mean of the new cluster. These steps are updated for some number of steps or until the cluster centers converge (they stop moving so much)<br>\n",
    "<b>Lets have a look at the steps of K-means clustering</b><br>\n",
    "1. Define the number of clusters \"k\" you want to group your data into<br>\n",
    "2. Randomly initialise k vectors with the same size as each datapoint, this is the initialisation of our cluster centers<br>\n",
    "3. Calculate the distance between each datapoint and each cluster center (using MSE or equivalent)<br>\n",
    "4. For every datapoint find the cluster center they are closest to<br>\n",
    "5. Re-calculate the cluster centers by finding the mean of every new cluster<br>\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 3-6 for n steps or until convergence"
